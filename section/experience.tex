\section{Professional Experience}
\cventry{2019--2020}{Affiliate}{Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}{USA (CA)}{}{I led investigation into flow classification on high-speed networks using state-of-the-art machine learning models and programmable network hardware. Work to be presented at IEEE GLOBECOM 2020.}
\cventry{2019}{Research Intern}{ESnet, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}{USA (CA)}{3 months}{I undertook the design, implementation, and testing of software written in Go for high-throughput stateful traffic analysis in the future design of a large-scale WAN. This included modification of programmable switch firmware, deep analysis of the network stack, and close integration with operations staff. Presented at IMC 2019.}
\cventry{2016}{Research Intern}{University of Glasgow}{Scotland}{2 months}{Problem model design, implementation and optimisation in Constraint and Integer Programming paradigms (Choco3 and Gurobi solvers), working with Prof.\ David Manlove and Dr.\ Patrick Prosser.}
