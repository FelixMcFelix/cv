\section{Professional Experience}
\cventry{\since{} 2021}{Research Associate}{University of Glasgow}{Scotland}{}{Researcher on the \emph{``TruSDEd: Trustworthy, Software-Defined Cyberattack Detection and Mitigation at the Network Edge''} project, supervised by Prof.\ Dimitrios P.\ Pezaros.}
\cventry{2019--2020}{Affiliate}{Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}{USA (CA)}{}{I led investigation into flow classification on high-speed networks using state-of-the-art machine learning models and programmable network hardware. Work presented at IEEE GLOBECOM 2020.}
\cventry{2019}{Research Intern}{ESnet, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}{USA (CA)}{3 months}{I undertook the design, implementation, and testing of software written in Go for high-throughput stateful traffic analysis in the future design of a large-scale WAN. This included modification of programmable switch firmware, deep analysis of the network stack, and close integration with operations staff. Presented at IMC 2019.}
