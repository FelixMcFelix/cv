\section{Professional Experience}
\cventry{\since{} 2021}{Research Associate}{University of Glasgow}{Scotland}{}{Currently investigating CPU and power-efficient data/control plane designs for low latency packet processing (Rust, XDP) on resource-constrained devices, with strong PUF-based authentication.}
\cventry{2019--2020}{Affiliate}{Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}{USA (CA)}{}{Led investigation into flow classification on high-speed networks using programmable network hardware. Work presented at IEEE GLOBECOM '20.}
\cventry{2019}{Research Intern}{ESnet, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}{USA (CA)}{3 months}{Designed, implemented, and tested software written in Go for high-throughput stateful traffic analysis in research WANs. This included deep analysis of the network stack and close integration with operations staff. Work presented at ACM IMC '19.}
\cventry{2017--2022}{Research Student}{University of Glasgow}{Scotland}{}{Researched the intersection of programmable hardware/host dataplanes with data-driven networking: online learning in resource-limited network devices, P4-based data reduction to enable classification at \qty{100}{\giga\bit\per\second}. Work published in IEEE TNSM, presented at IFIP NOMS '22 and ACM CoNEXT '21.}
