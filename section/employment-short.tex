\section{Professional Experience}
\cventry{\since{} 2023}{Extensibility Engineer}{Arista Networks}{}{}{Automation of datacentre networks (MP-BGP EVPN).}
\cventry{2021-2022}{Research Assistant}{University of Glasgow}{}{}{Designed CPU and power-efficient dataplanes for low latency packet processing (\emph{Rust, XDP}) on resource-constrained devices. Responsible for \emph{P4 BMv2$\rightarrow$Tofino} conversion on behalf of colleagues. Work to be presented at IFIP Networking '23.}
\cventry{2019--2020}{Affiliate}{Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}{}{}{Led investigation into flow classification on high-speed networks using programmable network hardware. Work presented at IEEE GLOBECOM '20.}
\cventry{2019}{Research Intern}{ESnet, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}{}{3 months}{Designed and implemented telemetry capture in \emph{P4}, and high-throughput stateful traffic analysis in \emph{Go} for research WANs. This included deep analysis of the network stack and close integration with operations staff. Work presented at ACM IMC '19.}
\cventry{2017--2022}{Research Student}{University of Glasgow}{}{}{Researched the intersection of programmable dataplanes with data-driven networking: online learning in resource-limited network devices, P4-based data reduction to enable classification at $\ge$\qty{100}{\giga\bit\per\second}. Work published in IEEE TNSM, presented at IFIP NOMS '22 and ACM CoNEXT '21.}
